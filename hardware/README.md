## Z-axis hardware

The Z-axis linear actuator of the Openbuilds C-beam machine has a spindle mount for attaching tools when used as a CNC machine.  This spindle mount is used to attached a syringe pump and BL-touch sensor.  The fully assembled Z-axis is illustrated below.

The image shows the approximate geometry of a mounted syringe and BL-touch sensor.  Openscad design files are included here for 3D printing the needed parts.
