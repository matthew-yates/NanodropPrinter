## Adjustable BL-touch mounting bracket

This is a height adjustable mount for a [BL-Touch sensor](https://www.antclabs.com/bltouch).  The sensor allows the location of the printing surface to be detected.  This mounting bracket is placed on the back side of the syringe pump.  The adjustable height of the bracket allows it to be used with syringes of varying length.  The image below shows the two parts of the bracket colored in blue and red.
