## Case for motion controller

Currently using the BigTreeTech SKR mini E3 V3.0 board with Marlin firmware to control movement.  The case for this control board and an LCD screen is decribed in a separate repository:

Possibly switching to a different control board in the future, which will require designing a new case.
