## Push pin holder

A needle point push pin was used for testing accuracy of motion. When the tip of the pin is pressed into a plastic printing surface, it leaves a mark that can be used for measuring location in XY coordinates. For these motion accuracy tests, a simple holder was designed, as shown below.

It consists of a main body (shown in red) that has an annular ridge on the outside for attaching the cap (shown in blue). Before attaching the cap, the needle point pin is inserted through a small cylindrical opening. The fully assembled part is shown below with the needle illustrated in magenta.

The outer diameter of the main body of the holder is approximately the same as that of a Hamilton 25 microliter syringe model 80222. When the push pin holder is clamped into the syringe pump, the sharp point is therefore located at the approximately the same location as the center of a needle attached to the 25 microliter syringe.
