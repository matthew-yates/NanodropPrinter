## Sender G-code motion commands via serial communication

The Jupyter notebook "gcodeSender.ipynb" is used to send an arbitrary sequence of G-code motion commands from an attached laptop through USB serial connection to the printer.  The motion commands are read from a comma separated variable file that has absolute positions of X, Y, Z, and E (syringe pump/extruder) in individual columns.  Two example csv files are provided that can be used with a pen plotter.  The file "circle.csv" plots a single circle having a radius of 30 mm.  The file "plotPoints.csv" produces 4 concentric rectangles used for linear lead screw travel calibration.

When sending commands via serial communication, the commands must be spaced apart in time in order to avoid overflowing the buffer on the printer controller.  When serial commands are sent too quickly, the buffer overflow will cause commands to be skipped. The Python script calculates the time required for each movement based on the maximum travel speed settings in firmware which are 5 mm/s for X, Y, and Z axes and 0.7 mm/s for the E axis (syringe pump plunger). Sleep times are added between motion commands to allow enough time for printer movement to complete before issuing the next motion command.
